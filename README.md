# ChibiPot Engine

This is my first 2D Engine which works with DirectX11 at the moment. It will support DirectX12 and Vulkan as well after I figure out how to implement multiple
graphics API.

ChibiPot Engine will only run a single static scene with no input for its initial scene. But I will try to figure how to make animation states before I create the complete scene.

## Workflow

### Initials
- [x] Window
- [x] DX Essentials (Device, Context, Swapchain & Render Target View)
- [x] Pixel Shader
- [x] Vertex Shader
- [x] Input Layout

### Mesh Architectures
- [x] Basic Model System
- [x] Sprite Model System

### Scene Components
- [ ] Tile Atlas
- [ ] Scene

## The Expected Scene
