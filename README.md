# ChibiPot Engine

This is my first 2D Engine which works with DirectX11 at the moment. It will be support DirectX12 and OpenGL after I figure out how to implement multiple
graphics API.

ChibiPot Engine will only run a single static scene with no input.

### Workflow

- [x] Window
- [x] DX DeviceContext
- [x] Swapchain
- [x] Render Target View
- [x] Pixel Shader
- [x] Vertex Shader
- [ ] Input Layout
- [ ] Sprite Model System
- [ ] Tile Atlas
- [ ] Scene

## The Expected Scene
